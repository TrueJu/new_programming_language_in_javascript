# New programming language in JavaScript
A programming language based on JavaScript. 

The code does the following:

- Lexing, reads the source file .tjx and creates tokens
- Parsing, understands the tokens and executes the code
<br/>
Here is a small example of what a **"Hello world!"** program with a function would look like:

```
$fncTest() {
    var test = "Hello world!";
    print(test);
}

%fncTest();
```
